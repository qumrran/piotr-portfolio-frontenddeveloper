	description: `As the saying goes — "If you don’t praise yourself, no one else will."
One beautiful day, I got interested in frontend development — and it stuck with me ever since.
I wake up at 5 a.m. to enjoy some peace and quiet — just to squeeze in some coding before work. Then, after work, when my family goes to sleep... and that’s how it’s been for the past few years.
Giving up Netflix and funny cat videos on YouTube started to wear on me a bit, so I decided to venture into deeper waters in search of my dream first job.
Goal: React Developer — but I’m open to other technologies too.
Privately, I spend every free day I can in the mountains. I’m passionate about Central Asian countries, art, and Carl Gustav Jung’s transpersonal psychology.
Feel free to check out my projects!
